# Python_grade_ranking v1.0

* * *

## Introduction

* This is a lightweight grade ranking tool fully developed in Python.
* Its main function is to accept user-input student information (student ID, name, score), rank the students from highest to lowest score (if scores are the same, ranking follows ascending student ID order), and display the final ranking results.

## Usage

1.  Download all project files to your local computer disk.
2.  Create a dedicated folder to store these files (Required).
3.  Open your IDE (VS Code is recommended), and create a virtual environment (.venv) according to the dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
4.  After the virtual environment is created, navigate to the project's src directory and run the main Python file (grade_ranking.py).
5.  Follow the program prompts to enter the total number of students and each student's ID, name, and score (scores must be between 0 and 120).
6.  After the program finishes running, you can view the formatted grade ranking results in the console.
